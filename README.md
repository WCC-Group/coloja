# coloja
Helper library to improve code coverage and mutation testing when using Lombok, jacoco and pitest.

= Use case =
Generated code through lombok doesn't get full coverage from your unit tests most of the time (it's generated after all). This can however interfere with your code coverage analysis, generating a lot of noise you don't want to see. This library helps you with that.
